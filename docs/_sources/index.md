# Data Viz with Plotly Express
## Introduction
This book introduce readers to Plotly Express, a Python library for interactive data visualization. 
Readers should have basic knowledge of Python and Pandas. As a refresher, appendix A provides 
a brief overview of Python and appendix B provides a brief overview of Pandas.

There are no shortage of data visualzation libraries in Python. Visualization libraries can be classified 
using two dimensions - Static vs Interactive and Low-level vs High-level.

Static visualization library only produce static charts while interactive visualization produces
interactive charts for exploration. The latter also support the download of the interactive chars
as static images for embedding in publication. 

Low-level libraries provide more flexibility for customization of charts at the cost of
complexity and learning curve. High-level libraries are simpler and easier to learn and use with less flexibility 
and functionality. The latter requires fewer lines of code than the former.

Table 1 provide a summary of comparison.

|                | Static     | Interactive |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
|**Low-level**   | Matplotlib | Plotly      | 
|**High-level**  | Seaborn    | *Plotly Express*, Altair, Bokeh | 

As depicted in table 1, Plotly Express is a high-level interactive library and is built 
on top of Plotly, a low-level interactive visualization library. Plotly is the best of both
world. It is simple and easy to learn and use. When you need the flexibity for more advanced
functionality, it provides access to the low-level functions of Plotly. Another benefit it is 
a part of Dash, a Python library for generating interactive dashboards. Interactive dashboards 
can be published as websites for sharing on the Internet.

This online book is a live book and can be read and run. Readers can interact with the exmple 
visualizations and can also open it in Google Colab to run it or download and run it in a Jupyter
Notebook environment of choice. 

This book provides minimal coverage on data preparation in order to
provide the focused coverage on Plotly Express. THere are plenty of resources available on data preparation 
using Pandas including videos, blog posts, and books. 

This book is organized by hands-on examples from a variety of problem domains from education to 
healthcare and from national culture to world development. Social researchers will find the topics 
interesting and relevant. Exposure to social issues will be helpful for technical professionals include data scientists 
and engineers.

Structure of each example:
1. Summary
    - Problem description
    - Data source
    - Technique used
2. Data Collection
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Visualization

Domains:
- Healthcare (FDA medical device recall, COVID-19)
- Economics (Capminer, Census Costs)
- Demograpy/Population
- Cultural(Donald Trump Tweets)
- Education (College scorecard)
